        \item[-] Zhejiang University, China \hfill Sep 2007 - Aug 2009
      \end{itemize}
	  \vspace{-1.1em}
      Expected Date of Graduation: Aug 2012 \\
      Two Bachelor Degrees from both Simon Fraser University and Zhejiang University

\section{Research Experience}
    {\sl Research Assistant} \hfill Jan 2011 - Apr 2011 \\
	{\sl Visualization for Fall Detection}\\
	Vision and Media Lab, Simon Fraser University, Canada
	\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
	    \item[-] Developed a system to visualize the nursing home fall detection video clips, assembled different patient fall videos into a integrated scene
		\item[-] Analyzed video data and integrated with minimum overlapping
	\end{itemize}

	{\sl Graduate Research Based Course} \hfill Jan 2011 - Apr 2011 \\
	{\sl Performance Comparison of MPI Workloads on HPC clusters versus Amazon EC2} \\
	Special Topics in Operating System, Simon Fraser University, Canada
	\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
	    \item[-] Designed benchmark sets to run on both academic HPC clusters and Amazon EC2 Cluster Compute Instances to compare the performance
		\item[-] Concluded with node compute capacity has consistent impact on performance, while interconnection has larger impact on cross communication tasks
		\item[-] EC2 Cluster Compute Instances can be competitive with the HPC cluster, at least for median sie CPU-intensive MPI applications
	\end{itemize}

	{\sl Graduate Research Based Course} \hfill Sep 2011 - Dec 2011 \\
    {\sl Trust-Based Community Discovery for Hierarchical Collaborative Filitering} \\
	Data Mining, Simon Fraser University, Canada
	\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
	    \item[-] New algorithm for discovering the community in social network in order to provide better results for recommendation systems
		\item[-] Took advantage of trust relation between different users for more accurate recommended items, with hierarchical layer decreases the processing time
	\end{itemize}
